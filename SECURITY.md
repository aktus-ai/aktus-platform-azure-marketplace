## Security Best Practices

### Deployment Security

1. **Network Security**
   - Use private subnets for AKS cluster nodes
   - Configure security groups to restrict traffic
   - Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
   - Use Azure Network Firewall for additional protection

2. **Access Control**
   - Use IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)
   - Implement least privilege access
   - Use Secrets Manager for sensitive data

3. **Container Security**
   - Scan container images for vulnerabilities
   - Use non-root containers where possible
   - Implement pod security policies
   - Enable runtime security monitoring

### Data Security

1. **Encryption**
   - Enable encryption at rest for EFS volumes
   - Use TLS/SSL for data in transit
   - Implement encryption for database connections
   - Secure API endpoints with proper authentication

2. **Data Handling**
   - Implement data classification policies
   - Use secure data processing pipelines
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance where applicable

### Monitoring and Logging

1. **Security Monitoring**
   - Use Security Hub for security findings
   - Implement centralized logging with CloudWatch
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all API access and modifications
   - Monitor user authentication events
   - Track data access patterns
   - Maintain audit trails for compliance
